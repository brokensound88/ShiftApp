## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Shift Protocol seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability?

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to [security@shiftprotocol.com](mailto:security@shiftprotocol.com).

You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

* Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.
